# pyRMT
Python for Random Matrix Theory. Implements several cleaning schemes for noisy correlation matrices, 
including the optimal shrinkage, rotationally-invariant estimator
to an underlying correlation matrix (as proposed by Joel Bun, 
Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Marc Potters and colleagues).

Such cleaned correlation matrix are known to improve factor-decomposition
via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and could be of relevance in a variety 
of contexts, including computational biology.

Cleaning schemes also result in much improved out-of-sample risk
of Markowitz optimal portfolios, as established over the years
in several papers by Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, Marc Potters and collaborators.

Some cleaning schemes can be easily adapted from the various shrinkage
estimators implemented in the sklearn.covariance module 
(see the various publications by O. Ledoit and M. Wolf listed below).

In addition, it might make sense to perform an empirical estimate
of a correlation matrix robust to outliers before proceeding with
the cleaning schemes of the present module. Some of those robust estimates
have been implemented in the sklearn.covariance module as well.
